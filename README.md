# Hello, world! 👋 I'm TheCodeWhisperer

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a coding astronaut exploring the universe of programming. I've been bending computers to my will for over a decade now. My tools of choice? Everything from React to Ruby on Rails, Angular to ASP.NET, and Python to PHP. I've also been known to dabble in C#, C++, and TypeScript, just to keep things interesting.

When I'm not busy building the web one site at a time, you can find me crafting mobile masterpieces for Android and iOS. Flutter and React Native? Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.

Oh, and did I mention I'm also a CMS whisperer? WordPress, Drupal, HubSpot - you name it, I've tamed it.

In my spare time, I enjoy long walks on the beach, candlelit dinners, and writing bios that make me sound like the James Bond of programming.
